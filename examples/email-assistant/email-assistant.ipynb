Regarding the user onboarding project and the API documentation update, we did face some challenges that caused slight delays. I've been working with the respective teams to address these issues and have some ideas on how we can get back on track. I'm available for a meeting early next week to discuss this in detail. How about Tuesday at 10 AM? Let me know if that works for you, and I'll send out a calendar invite. Looking forward to our discussion!\",\n",
